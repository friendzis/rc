# RC files

These are various configuration files used in my systems. I try to keep them organized and well commented (except obvious cases),
therefore they should be usable right away

### Installation

*The installation script is not ready yet!*

The script does have several security holes, but overall it is usable

With proper `config.json` should work out-of-the-box

  * Currently existance of a destination is not checked, therefore `--no-backup` flag must be used
  * Default `config.json` is not complete yet. Named regions should be implemented
