# RC files

These are various configuration files used in my systems. I try to keep them organized and well commented (except obvious cases),
therefore they should be usable right away

### Installation

*The installation script is not ready yet!*
Currently the installer generates \*NIX shell commands that can be piped to `xargs`
With proper `config.json` should work out-of-the-box
